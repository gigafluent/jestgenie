<br>

## I. Introduction. Regional Patterns (California)
Gigafluent Ltd. (“we,” “us” or “our”) takes your privacy seriously. This Privacy policy (“Privacy policy”) explains our data protection policy and describes the types of information we may process when you install and/or use the “JestGenie” software application for mobile devices (the “App”, “our App”).

When we refer to personal data (or personal information) we mean any information of any kind relating to a natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to such data.

It is a natural person who can be identified directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his or her physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural, or social status.

Our Privacy policy applies to all users, and others who access the App (“Users”).

For the purposes of the GDPR, we are the data controller, unless otherwise stated.

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY, FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE WAYS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED, CAREFULLY. WHEN YOU USE THE APP YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.

**IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT NOTICE**

All about the categories of information, its sources and purposes of processing >>
Please mind that according to CCPA personal information does not include de-identified or aggregated consumer information.

SHARING

How your information can be shared >>

Please note that all third parties that are engaged in processing user data are service providers that use such information on the basis of agreement and pursuant to business purpose.

OPT-OUT OPTIONS

If you don’t want us to process your personal information any more please contact us at vlad@gigafluent.com. In most cases there is no way to maintain the App’s further operating without functional data therefore you will be advised to remove the App from your device.

REQUESTS

To submit a verifiable consumer request for access, portability, or deletion of personal data please contact us at vlad@gigafluent.com. Please include in the text of your appeal the wording "Your rights to maintain confidentiality in the state of California”.

When submitting a verifiable request, you should be ready to:

- Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include: name, address, city, state, and zip code and email address. We may use this information to surface a series of security questions to you to verify your identity. If you are making a request through an authorized agent acting on your behalf, such authorized agent must provide written authorization confirming or a power of attorney, signed by you.
- Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We will not be able to respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot: (i) verify your identity or authority to make the request; or (ii) confirm that the personal information relates to you. We may ask you for additional information or documents to verify your identity. We may also carry out checks, including with third party identity verification services, to verify your identity before taking any action with your personal information. This is regarded as a safeguard measure to prevent disclosure of your personal information under a fake or scum request.

We ensure that personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request will be used only to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request and not for any other purpose. We will keep it for the adequate term reasonably needed for the purpose described above and delete after the purpose is fulfilled.

We try to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. Please note that we are only required to respond to two requests per customer each year.

EQUAL RIGHTS

Nothing in the way we deal with your request shall be interpreted as discrimination, which means that we will not set up different pricing or products, or different level or quality of services for you, if you choose to exercise your rights. However, in some circumstances, we may not be able to provide services if you choose to delete your personal information from our records.

SALE OF DATA

We do not sell any of your personal data to third parties.

## II. Information We Process
There are several categories of information that can be processed.

### Functional Information
We ask for and process the following information when you use the App. This information is necessary for the adequate **performance of the contract** between you and us. Without such information it is impossible to provide complete functionality of the App and perform the requested services.

- **User Content** (i. e. the images you take with the camera and send to the App, as well as any text, other content generated by AI via the App). Subject to your compliance with certain rules and restrictions outlined in our Terms of Use, you may dispose of, use, share, or otherwise exploit your User Content for your own purposes. However, any use of User Content is at your sole risk, i. e. you assume and bear all risks and responsibility associated with your use of User Content. It is your sole responsibility to ensure compliance with the applicable laws while using the User Content. Please note that we engage the third party service provider - OpenAI, L.L.C. - for the purpose of processing and creation of AI-generated User Content. Please check Section IV to learn more about the privacy policy and practices of OpenAI, L.L.C.
- **Contact Information** (name, e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the email) which you may fill in by yourself when you contact us via email. We use such information to respond effectively to your inquiry, fulfill your requests, send you communications that you request, and perform the requested services.

### Information That Is Processed Automatically
On the basis of your **permission**, we use third-party automatic data processing technologies (advertising or analytics tools) to analyze certain information sent by your device via our App. Some integrated advertising or analytics tools (check Section IV to see the list of them) launch automated processing of your personal data.

We may process some information about your device and your user behavior on the grounds of our legitimate interest. This information falls within the categories of data described above in the Subsection “Information That Is Processed Automatically”, it is generally non-personal, i.e. it does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual, and we may access it only in aggregated form. We use this information to improve our App and give our users the best experience.

- **Device Details**. When you use a mobile device to access our App, some of the details about your device are reported, including “device identifiers”. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device (but not your personality). Device identifier enables generalized reporting or personalized content and ads by the third parties.
What data can be processed:
    - Information about the device itself: type of your device, type of operating system and its version, model and manufacturer, screen size, screen density, orientation, audio volume and battery, battery life, loading time, latency, framerate, device memory usage.
    - Identifier for advertisers (IDFA)
- **Information about the applications**. Name, API key (identifier for application), version, properties of our App can be reported for automated processing and analysis. Some services also record the list of applications and/or processes which are installed or run on your device.
- **Log file information**. Log file information is automatically reported each time you make a request to access the App. It can also be provided when the App is installed on your device. When you use our App, analytics tools automatically record certain log file information, including time and date when you start and stop using the App, and how you interact with the App.
- **Ad-related information**. The following data might be reported about the ads you can view: the date and time a particular ad is served; a record if that ad was “clicked” or if it was shown as a “conversion” event; what the ad offer is about; what type of ad it is (e.g., text, image, or video); which ad placement is involved (where the ad offer is displayed within the App); whether you respond to the ad.
- **In-App events**. When you use our App, analytics tools automatically record in-App information (tutorial steps, leveling up, payments, in-app purchases, custom events, progression events, method of limiting the processing of user data).

Information provided automatically to analytics tools does not generally come under our control, therefore we cannot be responsible for processing such information. Please mind that some services are engaged in personal data profiling and may obtain information related to your personality and/or your device by using technologies that do not belong to our scope of responsibility. We do not control, supervise, or stand surety for how the third parties process your personal data, that might be collected by their own means (not through our App). Any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information should be directed to such third parties (see Section IV).

### Payment Information
Our e-commerce provider (Apple) is responsible for billing, processing, and charging for in-app purchases, handles your personal information, and keeps it absolutely safe and secure. This information is processed as part of the performance of the contract between you and us. We cannot access or use your credit or debit card information.

You may access the applicable “in-app” purchase rules and policies directly from the app stores.

<br>

## III. The Purposes of Processing Your Personal Data
Our mission is to constantly improve our App and provide you with new experiences. As part of this mission, we use your information for the following purposes:

(a) **To make our service available**. We use functional information and information that is processed automatically to provide you with all requested services.

(b) **To improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our App**. We use information that is processed automatically to better understand user behavior and trends, detect potential outages and technical issues, to operate, protect, improve, and optimize our App.

(c) **To provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content**.

We provide personalized content and information to you, which can include online ads or other forms of marketing.

(d) **To communicate with you**. We use your information to respond to you when you contact us.

(e) **To prevent fraud and spam, to enforce the law**. We really want our App to be free of spam and fraudulent content so that you feel safe and free. We may use your information to prevent, detect, and investigate fraud, security breaches, potentially prohibited or illegal activities, protect our trademarks and enforce our Terms of Use.

If any new purposes for processing your personal data arise we will let you know we start to process information on that other purpose by introducing the corresponding changes to this Privacy policy.

However, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted from us to any such third party. We are not responsible for any accidental loss or unauthorized access to your personal data through a fault of third parties.

We will not rent or sell your personal data to any third parties, but we may share your information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers, with third-party organizations that provide automatic data processing technologies for the App. We do not control or influence these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used.

## V. International Data Transfers
We work in the cross-border area and provide our App to our Users around the world.

We and third-party organizations that provide automatic data processing technologies for the App or our third-party advertising partners may transfer the automatically processed information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.

If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data processing that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as in your jurisdiction.

This means that your personal information can be transferred to a third country, a territory, or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or to the international organization where data protection and confidentiality regulations may not provide the same level of protection of personal data as your country does.

We try to make sure that the recipient of any personal data provides a proper protection of the personal data received, in accordance with the current legislation on the protection of such information. By using the App, you agree that we may transfer your personal data to any third country, a territory, or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or to the international organization.

For the purposes of data storage, we recourse to the services of the hosting organizations. We take your privacy seriously and, therefore, encrypt your personal data - if possible - before sending it to the hosting organizations for the purposes of its storage. Please note that we cooperate only with those hosting organizations that have passed our security and reliability check.

<br>

## VI. How Long We Use Your Personal Data
We generally retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for performing the functional service of the App and to comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want us to use your information that we physically access and store, you can request that we erase your personal information.

However, some data may still be stored for a certain time period (but no longer than the storage purpose requires) if information is necessary to comply with legal obligation (taxation, accounting, audit) or in order to maintain safety and data backup settings, prevent fraud or other malicious acts.

<br>

## VII. Exercising Your Rights
Applicable data protection laws give you certain rights regarding your personal information. You have the following options in relation to your personal information that was collected:

- **Data Access and Portability.** You can request copies of your personal information.
- **Change or Correct Data.** Where you cannot update data by yourself through your account, you have the right to ask to correct, change, update, or rectify your data.
- **Data Retention and Deletion.** The user data is generally retained for as long as your user profile is in existence or as it is needed to provide the relevant services. However, specific retention times can vary based on context of the processing performed. You have the right to ask to delete all or some of the personal data that is held about you.
- **Restriction of Processing.** Under certain circumstances, you may have the right to limit the ways in which your personal information is used.
- **Exercising the right to know about data sharing.** You have the right to know whether your data is shared with third parties. Detailed information on this issue is contained in section IV of the present Privacy policy, however, if you have further questions in this regard, you can contact us at any time.
- **Lodge a complaint.** You can lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes the GDPR.

To exercise any of the rights described above, you can contact us at vlad@gigafluent.com. Please bear in mind that we ensure the above mentioned rights only with respect to the information that we physically access and store.

When your personal information is processed automatically you may object to such processing in some circumstances. Where your personal information is processed for direct marketing purposes, you may ask to cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes. In order to exercise your right please contact the third-party services listed in the Section IV of this Privacy policy to learn how you can object to processing your data. Most of them have clear instructions on their privacy pages, functional API, or other options.

<br>

## VIII. How To Opt Out

### Opt-out of marketing tracking
You can manage your activity tracking permissions. Inter alia, if you do not want third-party service providers to use the personalized ads on the basis of your interests please follow the instructions below:

- Go to Settings > Privacy & Security (or “Privacy” in earlier versions of iOS) > Tracking, then tap to turn off or turn on permission to track for a specific app. You can also control whether apps can ask for permission to track your activity. If you do not want to be asked for your permission, or do not want apps to access your device’s Advertising Identifier, go to Settings > Privacy & Security (or “Privacy” in earlier versions of iOS) > Tracking and then disable the “Allow Apps to Request to Track” switch. If you turn off "Allow Apps to Request to Track", you will not get prompts from apps that want to track your activity. Each app that asks for permission to track while this setting is turned off will be treated as if you tapped “Ask App Not to Track”. Please find additional information here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212025 or in the Settings > Privacy & Security (or “Privacy” in earlier versions of iOS) > Tracking section on your device. If you want to disable Apple’s ad targeting, go to Settings > Privacy & Security (or “Privacy” in earlier versions of iOS) > Apple Advertising, then set the “Personalized Ads” switch to the “off” position. Please find additional information here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074

You can also visit https://youradchoices.com for the same purpose.

Please mind that when you opt out of certain interest based advertising, you may still continue to receive contextual ads based on other non-personal information, such as ads related to the content of other digital products you are using.

<br>

## IX. Security
The security of your personal information is highly important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal information.

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, which are designed to implement data-protection principles, such as data minimization, in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing. We seek your personal data to be encrypted with proper and strong encryption algorithms, including hashing where possible.

Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We do our best to protect your personal data, nevertheless, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. In the event that your personal information is compromised as a breach of security, we will promptly notify you in compliance with applicable law.

If you have any questions about the security of our App, you can contact us at vlad@gigafluent.com.

<br>

## X. Children’s Privacy
Our App is not intended for children under the age of eighteen (18). Therefore, we do not knowingly collect or solicit any personal information from children under eighteen (18). If you have not reached the age of majority or legal age in your jurisdiction (i.e. if you are between the ages of thirteen (13) and seventeen (17) years), your use of the App is possible only with the relevant consent and under the supervision of the holder of parental responsibility for you. **No one under the age of thirteen (13) may provide any personal information to the App.** If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of eighteen (18) without verification of the holder of parental responsibility for a child, we will erase that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under eighteen (18) and data processing is carried out without the relevant consent of the holder of parental responsibility for a child, please contact us.

<br>
